# Question

Lets decrypt this: [ciphertext](ciphertext)? Something seems a bit small

# Hint 

How could having too small an e affect the security of this 2048 bit key?
Make sure you dont lose precision, the numbers are pretty big (besides the e value)

# Solution

In order to solve this one I used an amazing tool - [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool)
