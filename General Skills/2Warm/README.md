# Question
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 

# Hint 
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

# Solution
Only need to covert bases , we can use python:

'0b101010'
 >>>

# Flag
picoCTF{101010}
