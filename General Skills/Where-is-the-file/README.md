# Question

I've used a super secret mind trick to hide this file. Maybe something lies in /problems/where-is-the-file_3_19c1a7766ac2747c446eb9666a9b4fb4.

# Hint 

What command can see/read files?
What's in the manual page of ls?

# Solution

used "ls -a" inorder to check if there are hidden files .
