# Question

I wrote you another song. Put the flag in the picoCTF{} flag format

# Solution

In [Musi1c]:https://github.com/netanelc305/picoCTF-2019/tree/master/General%20Skills/Mus1c I found out about Rockstar programming language... again we get code written in Rockstar , however this time we cant use https://codewithrockstar.com/online

so i downloaded Rockstar-to-Python transpiler from https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar and converted to code to python

```
Rocknroll = True
Silence = False
a_guitar = 19
Tommy = 44
Music = 160
the_music = input()
if the_music == a_guitar:
    print("Keep on rocking!")
    the_rhythm = input()
    if the_rhythm - Music == False:
        Tommy = 66
        print(Tommy)
        Music = 79
        Jamming = 78
        print(Music)
        print(Jamming)
        Tommy = 74
        print(Tommy)
        //They are dazzled audiences
        print(it)
        Rock = 86
        print(it)
        Tommy = 73
        print(it)
        break
        print("Bring on the rock!")
        Else print("That ain't it, Chief")
        break
```

by taking all the decimal values and convert them to Ascii we get the flag 


# Flag
